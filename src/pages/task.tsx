      <h1>## Problem 1: SALES TAXES</h1>
      <p>
        Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except
        books, food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an
        additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%,
        with no exemptions. When I purchase items I receive a receipt which
        lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax),
        finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of
        sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax
        rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the
        nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.

        shopping basketsâ€¦
